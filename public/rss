<p>From the beginning, VPNs have been largely been utilized by three groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Companies concerned with information security</li>
<li>Users concerned about privacy</li>
<li>People in countries where governments restricted access to information and communication</li>
</ol>
<p>Two decades after the advent of PPTP, the reasons why we use VPNs essentially haven’t changed. What has changed is the number of internet users now utilizing VPNs. The number of VPN users is now <a href="https://www.go-globe.com/blog/vpn-usage-statistics/">climbing by tens of millions of people each year</a>, and that number is projected to accelerate.</p>
<p>What’s behind this acceleration? An increasing number of people are concerned about their online privacy as data harvesting becomes more intrusive, more complete. And as internet use becomes intrinsically tied to our everyday lives, more governments are moving to restrict the type of information that their citizens can access.</p>
<p>A decade ago, only a small percentage of internet users were utilizing VPNs. Because of this, there was a sort of stigma—which still lingers today—around VPNs.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="the-desire-for-privacy-is-normal-not-suspicious">The desire for Privacy Is Normal, Not Suspicious</h3><p>To some, particularly in the U.S., there’s an idea that the desire for online privacy equates to a quest for anonymity in order to undertake illicit, nefarious activities. This narrative conjures images of the dark web. </p><p>But over the past few years, we’ve become aware of how pervasive online data capturing is. And at the same time, we’ve seen how our personal data can be sold or compromised by third parties. Because of that, people who just a short while ago were asking “Why would I need online privacy? I have nothing to hide,” are now asking “How can I better protect myself?”</p><p>Consider something as seemingly benign as looking up symptoms for a medical condition online. <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XPGXZYhKiM9">80% of Americans have searched health-related topics</a>, most without a second thought. What could go wrong? </p><p>When you look up a medical symptom, like any other page you visit on the internet, someone is capturing that data. The consequences of this could range from awkward—looking up a potentially embarrassing ailment only to have ads served back to you while in the company of others, too dangerous—once this data is sold in third-party apps, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/medical-symptoms/should-you-google-your-medical-symptoms/">a buyer may be able to steal your medical identity</a>. </p><p>For reasons like the above, many people—in nations where access to information and communication are relatively unhindered—are turning to VPNs simply for security and protection. </p><h3 id="access-to-information-communication-and-entertainment-isn-t-radical">Access to Information, Communication, and Entertainment Isn’t Radical</h3><p>Another narrative revolves around the idea that VPNs are the territory of radicals or militants. As more governments move to clamp down on communication and information, the notion of VPNs as simply a tool of activists or rebels fighting regimes is going away. In reality, most VPN users do so <a href="https://thebestvpn.com/vpn-usage-statistics/">to access entertainment, messaging apps, news websites, and social media</a>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/content/images/2019/11/vpn-usage-by-country.png" class="kg-image" alt="Why Ordinary People Are Turning to VPNs"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>In this way, we can see that the vast majority of people using VPNs in countries with repressive regimes are simply doing so in order to use the internet like anyone else. VPN usage isn’t nearly as radical in this sense as a government trying to control every detail of information that its citizens can see. China recently provided a good example of what this means. </p><p><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/wikipedia-china-block-censorship-tiananmen-square.html">In May, China moved to block all versions, in any language, of Wikipedia</a>. The timing of which (like previous blocks of Wikipedia) coincides with the anniversary of the 1989 events at Tiananmen Square. It’s quintessentially Orwellian. In the dystopian masterpiece 1984, Orwell wrote, “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.”</p><p>And China is far from alone. Turkey has blocked all of Wikipedia since 2017 in the name of “national security.” Iran consistently blocks articles it wants to hide from its citizens. </p><p>There’s something darkly unsettling about regimes so authoritarian that they try to hide the history of their recent past, shoveling it like dust into a rubbish bin, in order to try and gain support and control of the populace. There’s danger there, not only for the citizens of those countries, but for the rest of us hopeful of learning from past mistakes to create a better future as well.</p><p>As we’ve seen with Russian election meddling and the current distrust of Huawei, your data may seem safe but the likelihood of it ending up in the hands of a regime who exploits you is increasing by the day.  </p><h3 id="vpns-may-be-the-new-normal">VPNs May Be the New Normal</h3><p>If you look at the <a href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/vpn-use-data-privacy-stats/">list nations with the highest percentage of VPN users</a>, there’s a direct correlation between that list and government interference with an open internet. It’s a desire for access to information, communications with family abroad, or entertainment that makes VPNs so popular in these nations. </p><p>And in countries where we can actually stream our favorite series from an app or access Wikipedia, VPN use is still climbing as a result of data privacy concerns. </p><p>As long as governments and corporations continue to attempt to control our online experiences, the percentage of people utilizing VPNs is only going to grow. The old tropes of online privacy and access being the territory of the radical and nefarious are being ameliorated as the people in control of the internet force us to think of how we can protect and enable ourselves online. </p><p>The real question for many of us, now, is simply how can we find a <a href="https://medium.com/orchid-labs/why-we-need-a-better-vpn-aebe8c352984">VPN that promises us security and privacy in the way that we deserve</a>? </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pre-release Orchid App now available]]></title><description><![CDATA[Our initial feature is a local VPN traffic analyzer.

But what users don’t know is that many VPNs fail to provide the security and privacy that they advertise. It’s time for a product that we can trust — a truly decentralized solution that will deliver an open, inclusive internet free of censorship and data harvesting.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/content/images/2019/10/0_Fb9L1b2fWKa7l_EQ-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Why We Need a Better VPN"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>In much of the world, we’re now well into our third decade of online connectivity. In Europe and North America, <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-global-digital-overview" rel="noopener">internet access is now nearly universal</a>. In other nations, the possibilities of an online world are just emerging. But as access to the internet continues to expand around the globe, we’re seeing a troubling pattern: an increasing desire on the part of state actors and big corporations to own and control the internet.</p><p>It should come as no surprise that authoritarian regimes want to restrict the internet. From their perspective, the availability of information on the internet poses the greatest threat to control since the advent of the free press. As Ray Bradbury wrote in Fahrenheit 451, “If you don’t want a man unhappy politically, don’t give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none.”</p><p>This is the basic ethos of governments that embrace digital authoritarianism. And it goes well beyond stifling activists and dissidents. Under an authoritarian regime, anyone — journalists, comedians, musicians, and ordinary citizens — can be a target for daring to think differently or speaking out. Throughout the world, we see authoritarian governments attempting to control what types of information their citizens can access on the internet in an attempt to control their consciousness.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/content/images/2019/10/0_Sw3hpytKvf8BtDvX.png" class="kg-image" alt="Why We Need a Better VPN"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>In other places — also fighting for control — we have a corporately controlled internet. This model relies on the idea that in order to access information and connect with others, you have to give up the right to your digital self.</p><p>Corporate interests monitor and harvest our every contact and click, exploiting the fact that we rely on the internet for nearly every facet of our lives. They delve deep into our digital selves so that they can commodify our identities. For years, they’ve succeeded with only a whisper of pushback. But recent scandals highlighting the dangers of this model have people paying attention.</p><p>By 2017, <a href="http://www.telesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TeleSign-Consumer-Account-Security-Report-2016-FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener">research and polling</a> showed that Americans no longer trusted the widespread policy of corporate data harvesting:</p><ul><li>95% of Americans are concerned about how companies use their data</li><li>80% are more concerned than they were a year ago</li><li>50% are looking for new ways to safeguard their data</li></ul><p>The desire for a better internet that allows us to communicate and collaborate without censorship or data exploitation is growing around the world. The pincer movement being deployed by authoritarian and corporate interests has people looking to escape these two failed models of the internet, and global citizens are increasingly turning towards technology that helps them regain control of their digital experiences. For many, the solution is the use of a virtual private network (VPN).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="theriseofthevpn">The Rise of the VPN</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In their most basic sense, VPNs are intended to allow people to access the internet without fear of tracking, censorship, or having their personal information compromised. Because of this, we’re seeing a massive rise in their use.</p><p>Approximately 25% of internet users in the world now use a VPN each month. And that rise in users has led to a massive market to capitalize on user demand. Industry reports show that the VPN market is growing by billions of dollars each year, and is projected to more than triple, from $15.46 billion in 2016 to $54 billion by 2024.</p><p>Young people are a large reason for this projected increase; 68% of VPN users are under the age of 35. The reasons they’re using these services are relatable to anyone who has the internet. The primary reason people use a VPN is to access entertainment content; the secondary, to gain access to social networks and news.</p><p>At its core, this increased usage should be a good thing. People around the world are finding ways to circumvent the restrictive, exploitative nature of the current internet. But the reliance on VPNs to help make a better internet relies on one basic premise: complete trust in the company behind the VPN.</p><p>As the market for VPN services grows, consumers are presented with increasing options. We have to ask ourselves: Do each of these services really offer us the security and privacy that a VPN is meant to deliver? Sadly, the answer is no.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whycurrentvpnscantsolveourbiggestchallenges">Why Current VPNs Can’t Solve Our Biggest Challenges</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The problems go right to the core technology of most VPNs. Today, most VPNs rely on a centralized system, and this structure is inherently impossible to trust. Centralized VPNs are susceptible to firewall blockages and often rely on remaining compliant with governments in order to operate. By their very nature, they can’t provide the user with the benefits desired.</p><p>For VPN users in nations with regimes attempting to control the flow of news and information, governments heavily regulate the VPN industry. Operating within many nations means that a VPN provider has to register or get licensed with the government. How is it possible to trust a VPN approved by a government attempting to control and monitor online traffic? For instance, roughly 60% of the top, free VPN services are based in China. Do we have faith that the Chinese government is allowing the services to operate without monitoring user behavior?</p><p>In nations where the population enjoys unfettered access to news and information, another threat arises — a lack of transparency on the part of VPN providers. In a study of the world’s 115 most popular VPNs, 26 were found to be keeping tabs on their users. While marketing language may argue otherwise, the business model for many free VPNs is based on the provider harvesting and selling the users’ personal data. Buried in that fine print at the bottom of the terms and conditions is the acquiescence of consent.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://orchid-ghost-admin.circleclick.com/content/images/2019/10/0_DOEy9TgdGBuFcLqq.png" class="kg-image" alt="Why We Need a Better VPN"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Sold as a way to ensure private, secure browsing, the companies behind VPNs are actually tracking user data related to bandwidth, connection timestamps, IP addresses, and websites visited. Users who rely on services like this are often unaware they are being monitored and tracked. We’re left asking: To whom is the data sold to and for what purpose?</p><p>In other words, while internet users are attempting to gain access free of censorship and personal data mining, the services they use to do that are compounding the issue by exploiting their trust. At the heart of this problem is the issue of centralization. A centralized system requires complete trust on the part of the user, and with complete trust comes the ability to exploit it.</p><p>Security and protection pose additional threats. The vast majority of VPNs rely on single-hop service, which allows interested parties to discover both where traffic is coming from and where it is going. Traditional VPN traffic also leaves a signature that is relatively easy to spot. For users in countries where attempting to access a news website, like the BBC, or a social network, like Facebook, presents the threat of imprisonment, this is a very real danger.</p><p>While there have been genuine attempts to alleviate the above issues via the use of decentralized VPNs, the attempts thus far have fallen short. VPNs featuring the use of decentralized servers have relied on a system of volunteers to act as nodes to power the system. While these services have gained some traction, the lack of volunteers has led to systems that lack the bandwidth, computational capacity, and servers to create a truly secure, private online experience.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="buildingabettervpn">Building a Better VPN</h2>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Orchid Labs’ mission is to build open source software that keeps the Internet open and accessible — a natural resource for everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Our first step to fulfill that mission is to create a protocol that governs a decentralized marketplace with a commodity specification for bandwidth. One key element of the marketplace is a second layer payment solution, “Probabilistic Micropayments”, which adds transaction throughput and privacy to Ethereum. Another is a Medallion system for bandwidth providers that grants the network Sybil resistance and hardens it to other classes of attacks. More detail is laid out in our <a href="https://www.orchid.com/assets/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf" rel="noopener">whitepaper</a>.</p><p>The first application that buys bandwidth on our marketplace will be the Orchid App (coming soon to iOS and Android!). The Orchid App is an open source VPN client with added security features, such as multi-hop routing. The goal with the software is to provide secure access to the open Internet, right in line with our mission. We also hope to play a part in driving the VPN market towards more transparency, privacy and fairer pricing.</p><p>Other applications can be built that harness the power of our protocol and bandwidth marketplace. The Orchid App will serve as a first example and we are excited to discuss potential integrations. Email our team at <a href="mailto:%22partners@orchid.com%22" rel="noopener">partners@orchid.com</a> to talk to us.</p><p>As we have been building over the past year, we continue to see concerning developments across the globe as the Internet splinters and new forms of communication control are put into place. We believe that our contribution can help the world become openly connected.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="progressin2019">Progress in 2019</h2>

The current centralized system, which limits our ability to communicate and learn — while also harvesting and selling our personal data — is far from the full potential of what the internet could be and strays from the original intention of its creators.</p><p>That’s why we’ve launched the Orchid Protocol, an open-source overlay network that uses excess bandwidth on top of the existing Internet to ensure that people — no matter where they live on our planet — can have unrestricted access to information and collaboration. Orchid’s protocol combines surplus bandwidth, state-of-the-art encryption, and a decentralized infrastructure enabling any Internet user to participate and exchange bandwidth for payment in peer-to-peer transactions using Orchid tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Our team consists of engineers, cryptocurrency experts, technologists, and partners dedicated to creating an Internet free of surveillance and censorship. This idea isn’t new; there are people across the globe dedicated to this cause. We believe the Orchid Protocol will help the world finally create this reality.</p><p>While I’ve been interested in the idea of Internet freedom for some time, the origins of Orchid stem from conversations with Steve Bell, an entrepreneur with more than a decade of experience backing Chinese seed stage startups. We had both personally experienced and witnessed the consequences of surveillance and censorship in our work across the world. My concern was one of surveillance, while Steve’s was one of censorship or access. My perspective was, “how do communicate or access information in a potentially totalitarian state in a private fashion”. I had also experience security issues first hand, both during the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/05/bitstamp-bitcoin-exchange-hack/" rel="noopener">Bitstamp hack of 2015</a> and in having my own phone <a href="https://medium.com/@stevewaterhouse/notes-on-recovering-from-a-hack-3cd438e10fe0" rel="noopener">ported</a>.</p><p>We started discussing ways to create an internet free of surveillance and censorship that everyone in the world could access. With a passion for where we wanted to go and a firm idea of how to get there, we knew we needed the technological expertise and funding to make this happen.</p><p>Fortunately, we’ve met many technologists and partners who are also passionate about this cause, and who believe in Orchid’s ability to transform the way that users can utilize and access the Internet.</p><p>Olaf Carlson-Wee from <a href="http://polychain.capital/" rel="noopener">Polychain Capita</a>l is an investor who focuses on emerging Internet-based technologies. “We’ve invested in a number of projects that I would say focus on preserving privacy on the Internet and enabling people to use the Internet in a more free and open way,” he said. “I’d say that cryptocurrency largely falls into this category as well. We invested in Orchid because we think it’s the most sophisticated project we’ve seen to date that’s trying to solve problems within this space.”</p><p>Steve Bell had worked with open-source advocate and technologist Brian J. Fox in more than one venture. Steve and Brian had been talking years earlier about the different ways in which restrictive firewalls could be bypassed, enabling freedom of speech on the Internet. When the three of us met to discuss the Orchid mission, it became clear that we had the makings of the core team well underway. Brian had known the software engineer and developer of Cydia, Jay Freeman, for years, and Jay helped us take our project from concept to development stage.</p><p>For an expert in creating the technology for an alternative funding model, we turned to Gustav Simonsson, an engineer and developer who helped launch Ethereum. Together, this team brings an immense amount of passion, experience, and expertise that can make the goal of an uncensored, surveillance-free Internet a reality. We believe that together, we’ve created a protocol that will transform the current power structure of the Internet and benefit every Internet user in the world.</p><p>One of our first investors, W. Bradford Stephens of <a href="http://blockchain.capital/" rel="noopener">Blockchain Capital</a>, has known and worked with me for years. “We support blockchain enabled technologies and when you have an idea that can impact and empower billions of people by creating a more open and inclusive Internet — with the right technology and team — we realized the benefit could affect everyone, no matter where you are on the planet.”</p><p><a href="https://dfj.com/" rel="noopener">DFJ Venture Capital</a>, another of our partners, believes, “Mission- and purpose-driven businesses last longer. Like open-source communities working on a common goal. These galvanizing rods let people do amazing work. You want your employees and customers to be rooting for you. You can make money anywhere, whereas changing the world, it transcends your existence, and money never does that.”</p><p>The Internet is the most powerful tool for gathering information and collaborating that’s ever existed. At Orchid Labs, we believe in order for its fullest potential to be reached, this tool needs to be available for everyone, free of censorship and surveillance, and it needs to protect each user’s personal data.</p><p>Because of the passion and expertise of our team, and investors who believe in this mission and our ability to actuate it, we have the technology, drive, and resources to make this dream a reality. If you believe in these same ideals, and an approach that combines open-source technology backed by cryptocurrency, we hope that you’ll join us in our mission to realize a better Internet.</p><p>Web: <a href="https://orchidprotcol.com/" rel="noopener">Orchid Protocol</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/orchidprotocol" rel="noopener">@orchidprotocol</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
