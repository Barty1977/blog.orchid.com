Orchid has added support for WireGuard®️, a fast-growing VPN protocol, for all users across iOS, macOS, and Android. People can now configure multiple [hops](/what-is-a-hop/#:~:text=Hops%20is%20how%20we%20at,exiting%E2%80%9D%20to%20its%20destination%20webpage.) through WireGuard, OpenVPN and/or the Orchid network to protect their Internet traffic and stay private online.

Orchid Co-founder and CEO Steven Waterhouse said: 
> Several of the leading VPN providers on the market support WireGuard. This integration will offer our users even more flexibility in configuring hops across multiple bandwidth providers to ensure the highest possible level of Internet privacy."

Orchid is a unique VPN app that lets people split their traffic into "hops" across multiple nodes, providers and protocols. Users can fund an Orchid account using its native digital currency, [OXT](/how-oxt-works-on-the-orchid-network/), and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis. People using the iOS and macOS apps can also purchase pre-filled accounts through [in-app purchases](/why-orchids-in-app-purchases-are-a-game-changer-for-dapp-usage/), with no need to obtain cryptocurrency or use a wallet. Orchid is completely ad-free and the app contains no tracking software.

[WireGuard ](https://www.wireguard.com/)is a VPN protocol that has experienced strong growth and user adoption due to its technical innovations that offer simplicity, speed, and greater security due to its smaller attack surface and superior cryptography.

Many VPN providers run WireGuard servers. The open-source project provides both server and client code that allows users to tunnel to the server and exit their traffic. WireGuard support further strengthens Orchid's VPN functionality, which also includes OpenVPN and the Orchid protocol. On the Orchid network, users can get service from multiple top providers such as [LiquidVPN](/orchid-partners-with-liquidvpn/), [PIA](/pia-bringing-trusted-private-bandwidth-to-orchid-users/), [Tenta](https://tenta.com/), [Boleh](https://www.bolehvpn.net/), and [VPNSecure](/orchid-partners-with-vpnsecure/) and pay via OXT.
