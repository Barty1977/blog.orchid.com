[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/), one of the largest and most respected crypto trading platforms [with over 4 million users](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kraken#section-overview), will list OXT as of Tuesday, June 2. Kraken is consistently rated as one of the best and most secure cryptocurrency exchanges, and offers one of the largest selections of coins currently available.

New Orchid users can open an account by purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH on Kraken. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code will appear that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a simple, one-step setup.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid’s Co-Founder and CEO said: “Kraken is widely considered one of the crypto industry’s top exchanges. Their decision to list OXT is a vote of confidence for Orchid and our vision for a safe, open Internet. We are excited to welcome members of the Kraken community into our own.”

Orchid’s unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. Users use OXT to fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis.
