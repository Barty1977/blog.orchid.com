OXT, the Orchid token, will be listed this Thursday, June 4 on the [Bitcoin.com](https://exchange.bitcoin.com/) Exchange, a trading platform that supports leading digital assets. On the exchange traders can securely buy, sell, and invest in cryptocurrencies.

New Orchid users can open an account by purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH on the Bitcoin.com Exchange. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code will appear that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a simple, one-step setup.

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. Users use OXT to fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO said: "We are excited that OXT is now supported by Bitcoin.com. Orchid's listing on this high-quality exchange will allow even more people to access our decentralized VPN marketplace and use the Internet with greater privacy. We look forward to welcoming members of the Bitcoin.com community into our own."

> Especially during times like now, the importance of privacy cannot be stressed enough. Therefore, we're thrilled to support a blockchain company that combines Internet privacy with the benefits of a decentralized network and all of that in a user-friendly manner. We're looking forward to listing the Orchid token and can't wait to see where their journey takes them."
