The [Orchid](https://www.orchid.com/) team will be returning to Consensus this May ---- and in a whole new format!

CoinDesk's annual conference in New York City has long been a focal point for the blockchain industry and community. This year, it has been reformatted as a virtual event and given a new name: "Consensus: Distributed." While throngs of digital currency enthusiasts may not be descending in-person upon Times Square, Consensus: Distributed is expected to bring together thousands of attendees interested in blockchain and other forward-thinking technologies.

At Orchid, it's our mission to help solve a crucial problem shared by billions of people worldwide: how to maintain privacy in an era of "surveillance capitalism." With support from our community, we have developed a peer-to-peer privacy bandwidth marketplace powered by blockchain. We can't wait to step onto the big stage and share with you the strides Orchid has taken already in 2020 in promoting an open and accessible Internet.

We are honored that the organizers of Consensus: Distributed have hand-picked Orchid for inclusion in this year's boldest initiative: "Foundations," a new program that gives the most impactful blockchain-related projects their own mini-conference as a showcase to the community. This will give our team the opportunity to customize our programming with a series of sessions. Watch this space and stay tuned for more details about what we will be covering and how you can participate in the big event, which starts for Orchid on **Monday,  May 12th at 10:00 AM.**
