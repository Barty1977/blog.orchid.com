We know many of you are wondering what the best way is to earn OXT, Orchid's native digital currency. There are currently a number of ways people can earn, with more planned for the future.

Right now anyone can earn OXT by participating in the [CoinList Rewards](https://tsm.coinlist.co/help/orchid-oxt-rewards) program. CoinList Rewards is designed to incentivize users to learn about different projects via educational content, complete tasks like interacting with smart contracts, and earn crypto for doing so. Orchid was honored to be chosen as the partner for CoinList's first such campaign.

Here's how to earn OXT with CoinList Rewards:

1.  Sign into your CoinList account
2.  Visit coinlist.co/asset/orchid
3.  Learn about Orchid & OXT
4.  Complete the tasks
5.  Earn OXT distributed directly into your CoinList Wallet

CoinList has launched the program with educational content, letting users earn $5 in OXT by learning about Orchid, as well as up to $50 in total rewards for completing more advanced tasks in the future.

In addition to CoinList, people can **join Coinbase's [Earn campaign](https://www.coinbase.com/earn/orchid) to earn OXT** while learning about Orchid, with no need to run a node or sell bandwidth. The campaign is currently live.

OXT, Orchid's native, ERC20-compatible digital currency, is an integral component of the network. All transactions on Orchid involve OXT, with users paying bandwidth providers for service in the digital currency. It enables market incentives, security, and efficient operation of the network. Among other functions, OXT drives activity and ensures the maintenance of an adequate supply of bandwidth on Orchid.

In the future, people will be able to earn OXT easily by running a node and providing bandwidth on Orchid. Leading VPN providers including [LiquidVPN](/orchid-partners-with-liquidvpn/), [PIA](/pia-bringing-trusted-private-bandwidth-to-orchid-users/), [Tenta](https://tenta.com/), [Boleh](https://www.bolehvpn.net/), and [VPNSecure](/orchid-partners-with-vpnsecure/) are among the groups that are already doing so, and ultimately anyone, from a large organization to a single person, will have the ability to be a provider on the network. We will provide updates on the ability of individuals to run Orchid nodes as they become available.
