[Gemini](https://gemini.com/), the global cryptocurrency exchange and custodian launched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2015, will soon allow its users to access Orchid's digital currency, OXT.Â  Gemini customers can deposit OXT in their account starting Friday, April 24th at 9:30am ET, with trading to follow shortly thereafter. Partnering with Gemini continues to advance Orchid's global expansion goals, as the exchange accepts customers from various countries across the globe. As the world's first licensed ether exchange, Gemini aligns with the foundation of Orchid's vision of a decentralized Web 3.0.

Orchid co-founder and CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse said: "Gemini's established history as a globally licensed, trusted name in crypto markets make them a perfect partner for Orchid as we continue making OXT widely available. Partnering with Gemini, ensures a safe environment, where users can confidently purchase private bandwidth."

"Orchid gives you back control over your privacy and represents one of the many promises of crypto. We are delighted to support this mission-oriented project and make it available to our customers for trading and custody," said Cameron Winklevoss, President of Gemini.

Orchid is a unique VPN: it is powered by a digital currency, so paying for bandwidth doesn't require any centralized party. VPN service in the app is purchased with OXT from the connected account, and you pay only for the bandwidth that you actually use. New Orchid users can open an account by creating an Ethereum address using Metamask or another Ethereum wallet, and purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH from Gemini or another exchange. Once the account is created, a QR code appears that contains account credentials that you can share with as many friends, family, or devices as you'd like. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step setup.

This listing continues Orchid's international expansion, following our listings on Bittrex Global, OKEx, and five new Orchid app language translations (Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Korean, and Japanese) [announced March 27th](https://blog.orchid.com/oxt-now-live-on-okex/).
