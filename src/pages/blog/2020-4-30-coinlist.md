CoinList has serviced more than $800 million in token sales by over 10,000 global investors, as it provides a platform for startups to raise capital using tools such as airdrops, token sales, and hackathons. After a successful fundraising round in 2019, with support from the likes of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, it launched a crypto exchange and wallet.

Orchid co-founder and CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse said: "We are thrilled to have such a trusted partner in CoinList. Our community can feel confident when purchasing OXT on a platform with a proven track record of regulatory compliance and security best practices."

CoinList President Andy Bromberg said:
> Orchid is a rare find in crypto --- a product that directly benefits a huge number of people around the world, and one that is live today. We're thrilled to be listing OXT for trading on CoinList to allow users to get access to Orchid's services and participate in the community."

Orchid is a unique VPN: it is powered by a digital currency, so paying for bandwidth doesn't require any centralized party. VPN service in the app is purchased with OXT from the connected account, and you pay only for the bandwidth that you actually use. New Orchid users can open an account by creating an Ethereum address using Metamask or another Ethereum wallet, and purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH from CoinList or another exchange. Once the account is created, a QR code appears that contains account credentials that you can share with as many friends, family, or devices as you'd like. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step setup.

The CoinList listing follows listings on Coinbase, Gemini, Bittrex Global, OKEx, and five new Orchid app language translations (Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Korean, and Japanese) [announced March 27th](https://blog.orchid.com/oxt-now-live-on-okex/).
