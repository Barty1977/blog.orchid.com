OKEx, one of the world's largest digital asset exchanges, will now allow its millions of customers around the world trade and transact in Orchid's digital currency, OXT. With the OKEx listing, OXT is now available to power secure internet browsing and communication in more than a hundred countries around the world. Orchid's latest release adds support for Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indonesian and Russian-speaking users.

Orchid co-founder and CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse (Seven) said: “Surveillance and censorship are growing internationally — this is a pattern we've seen emerge in the wake of previous crises. OKEx listing Orchid makes it easier for international users to acquire OXT and start using it to access private bandwidth; this is an important day for the growth of internet freedom.”

“Orchid is a perfect case to show how the combination of token economic model and commercial application works. We are happy to be able to have OXT as a member of the OKEx ecosystem, where we strive to offer professional and retail traders one-stop trading services while promoting mutually with the project teams,” said Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx. “We will continue to find quality investment projects and provide enhanced trading experience for our global users.”

Orchid is a unique VPN: it is powered by a digital currency, so paying for bandwidth doesn't require any centralized party. VPN service in the app is purchased with OXT from the connected account, and you pay only for the bandwidth that you actually use. New Orchid users can open an account by creating an Ethereum address using Metamask or another Ethereum wallet, and purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH from OKEx or another exchange. Once the account is created, a QR code appears that contains account credentials that you can share with as many friends, family, or devices as you'd like. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step setup.
