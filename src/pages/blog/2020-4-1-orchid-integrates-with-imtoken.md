Today, Orchid announces its new integration with [imToken](http://token.im), one of most popular crypto wallet providers in the world.

imToken was established in May 2016, and expanded its user base to 10 million crypto holders from more than 200 countries, including 8 million in China. Orchid's latest release adds support for Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Indonesian and Russian-speaking users.

New Orchid users can open an account by creating an Ethereum address using imToken and purchasing at least $4 in OXT (you can get it on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid) and [OKEx](https://www.okex.com/)) and $1 of ETH. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code appears that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step setup.

Orchid CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse said: "Taking our privacy network global requires the right set of international partners. imToken has done great work in building a secure and user-friendly product --- many more users will now have an easy way to hold their OXT and use it to buy private bandwidth."

Philipp Seifert of imToken said: "The freedom to use an open web is critical to our users. We're thrilled to engage with Orchid's lively global community and make it easier for anyone to access and use OXT."\
