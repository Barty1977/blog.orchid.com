Today, Orchid announces OXT integration with [Edge](https://edge.app/), a leading non-custodial wallet platform with nearly one million users worldwide. Available on iOS and Android, Edge is renowned by its legion of loyal users for its beautiful interface, security, and seamless incorporation with global exchanges to provide fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto exchange services. Over the last quarter, Edge's user base saw 73% growth, showcasing its rapid expansion.

Founded in 2014 in San Diego, California, Edge made its mark developing a secure multi-asset mobile wallet offering privacy, autonomy, and protection, on personal mobile devices. Edge's client-side encryption secures users' private keys without leaving their personal device, enabling a truly decentralized wallet protection. As a result, Edge makes it easy to securely send, receive, buy, sell, and exchange cryptocurrencies all from your phone.

New Orchid users can open an account by  creating an Ethereum address on the Edge app and purchasing at least $4 in OXT (available[ on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid)) and $1 of ETH.  Once the account is created, a shareable QR code appears that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step setup.

Paul Puey, Edge Wallet CEO, said: "Orchid's OXT stood out to us as one of the most powerful and useful tokens to come to market. Every integration we make brings us closer to fulfilling our mission of broadening access to a variety of cryptocurrencies. Our team is looking forward to this collaboration in order to create a better digital ecosystem for all."

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO, said: "It's important for our users to have a safe and secure way of storing their OXT. We are excited to partner with Edge, one of the world's leading non-custodial wallets, to assist in furthering our vision of a private internet."
