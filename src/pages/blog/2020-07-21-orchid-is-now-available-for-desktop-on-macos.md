The Orchid app is now available for desktop on MacOS. This release will allow the operating system's [100 million users](https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/30/apple-passes-100m-active-mac-milestone-thanks-to-high-numbers-of-new-users#:~:text=Advertise%20on%20AI-,There%20are%20now%20100%20million%20active%20Macs,high%20number%20of%20new%20adopters&text=Apple%20has%20reached%20a%20new,and%20MacBooks%20around%20the%20world.) to browse the Internet in privacy using Orchid's unique, decentralized VPN marketplace.

Orchid uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. People can use [OXT](https://www.orchid.com/how-it-works#oxt), the Orchid digital currency, to fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis. [In-app purchases](/orchid-launches-in-apple-app-store/#:~:text=In%2Dapp%20purchases%20give%20people,App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Playstore.) -- currently available for iOS -- will be available for MacOS starting immediately. In-app purchases let people buy a pre-filled Orchid account and use the service without the need to acquire or transfer OXT.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO said: "Many more people are now at home and surfing the Internet from a desktop, so it's essential that we expand the places where Orchid is available in order to meet their needs. Orchid is committed to offering the best possible Internet privacy across operating systems and devices, and the MacOS release is a big step in that direction."

In March, Orchid [outlined](/actions-taken-in-response-to-covid-19/) its decision to prioritize desktop clients in order to support increased numbers of people accessing the Internet from their desktops at home. With the coronavirus pandemic likely to keep remote work commonplace for the foreseeable future, access to strong Internet privacy tools is more important than ever.

Further updates, including announcements regarding in-app purchases for MacOS, will be shared in the coming months.
