OXT support is being included as part of [Abra's](https://www.abra.com/) latest app release for iOS and Android. Users will be able to buy, hold, deposit, and withdraw OXT as well as trade it for any other token via any Abra app. The first release will be for non US users only although Abra hopes to bring OXT support to US users in the future.

Orchid Co-Founder and CEO Steven Waterhouse said: "Abra is one of the best-known platforms in the crypto space and we are excited that they have chosen to include OXT in their app. This is validation of all the hard work we have done since launching Orchid late last year to let people browse the Internet and stay curious."

Abra operates an easy to use app allowing users to buy, sell, store, and invest in cryptocurrencies, plus manage all crypto investments, in one single place. Abra's vision is an open, global financial system that is easily accessible to everyone.

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. Users use OXT to fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis.
