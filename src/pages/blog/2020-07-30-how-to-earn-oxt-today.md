There are a number of ways people can earn OXT, Orchid's native digital currency. The most straightforward is to run a node and provide bandwidth on Orchid. Leading VPN providers including [LiquidVPN](/orchid-partners-with-liquidvpn/), [PIA](/pia-bringing-trusted-private-bandwidth-to-orchid-users/), [Tenta](https://tenta.com/), [Boleh](https://www.bolehvpn.net/), and [VPNSecure](/orchid-partners-with-vpnsecure/) are among the groups that are already doing so, and anyone, from a large organization to a single person, can be a provider on the network.

And we're rolling out new initiatives to make it easier to earn OXT. In December, we [announced](/orchid-partners-with-bloq/) a partnership with [Bloq](https://www.bloq.com/), a leading blockchain infrastructure innovator. This partnership adds even more incentives, including helping users earn revenue from the exchange of private bandwidth. With this interface users will be able to delegate their OXT stake to bandwidth providers, letting them earn without needing to run an Orchid node or sell bandwidth themselves.

You can [sign up today to join the waitlist](https://www.bloq.com/orchid/) for Bloq's staking interface, which will be released later this year.

There are still more ways for people to earn OXT. Coinbase's [earn campaign](https://www.coinbase.com/earn/orchid) lets people do so while learning about Orchid, with no need to run a node or sell bandwidth. The campaign is currently live.

OXT, Orchid's native, ERC20-compatible digital currency, is an integral component of the network. All transactions on Orchid involve OXT, with users paying bandwidth providers for service in the digital currency. It enables market incentives, security, and efficient operation of the network. Among other functions, OXT drives activity and ensures the maintenance of an adequate supply of bandwidth on Orchid.
