Do you have a preferred VPN service? Now you can use Orchid alongside that existing VPN subscription as you create hops between nodes to better control your privacy online.

Watch the 3-minute [demo](https://youtu.be/sxmOZ09XWo8) of Orchid's new feature where [Alex Kehaya](https://twitter.com/afkehaya), head of business development, walks you through the example of using [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) (PIA), one of the early bandwidth providers on the Orchid network.

Follow the demo as Alex shows the easy process 

-   to set up a first Orchid hop by [scanning a QR code](https://blog.orchid.com/get-hopping-faster-making-privacy-easier-with-qr-codes/) 

-   then further obfuscate traffic from your connection as you connect to your VPN provider of choice

-   by using an Open VPN configuration and your existing VPN subscription to create a second hop

"You can create all these really cool circuits where you can connect back to another Orchid hop or you can add another open VPN configuration if you wanted to," Alex says.
