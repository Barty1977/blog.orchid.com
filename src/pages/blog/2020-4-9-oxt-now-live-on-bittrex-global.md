Bittrex Global, the international digital asset trading platform based in Liechtenstein, will now allow its users to access Orchid's digital currency, OXT. Bittrex Global accepts customers around the world (excluding the U.S.), marking a continuation of Orchid's international expansion.

Orchid co-founder and CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse said: "Bittrex has a long-standing commitment to security, a value that we share here at Orchid. Making OXT widely available for our users in Europe and around the world is an important step in making it easy for anyone to start using it to pay for private bandwidth."

Bittrex Global EO Tom Albright said:Â  "With data privacy and security more important than ever, it's exciting to partner with an innovative VPN provider in Orchid. Our companies share a mission around security, and we believe the use of digital currency in this space represents a significant step forward and a huge opportunity. We're pleased to be making OXT available to our customers on the Bittrex Global platform."

Orchid is a unique VPN: it is powered by a digital currency, so paying for bandwidth doesn't require any centralized party. VPN service in the app is purchased with OXT from the connected account, and you pay only for the bandwidth that you actually use. New Orchid users can open an account by creating an Ethereum address using Metamask or another Ethereum wallet, and purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH from Bittrex or another exchange. Once the account is created, a QR code appears that contains account credentials that you can share with as many friends, family, or devices as you'd like. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step setup.

Orchid is available for two trading pairs on Bittrex Global: OXT/USDT and OXT/BTC. This listing continues Orchid's international expansion, following our listing on OKEx and five new Orchid app language translations (Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Korean, and Japanese) [announced March 27th](https://blog.orchid.com/oxt-now-live-on-okex/).
