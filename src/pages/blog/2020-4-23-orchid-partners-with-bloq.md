Building the Orchid network is a global effort that requires collaboration with many entities, from tech innovators to privacy service providers to the individual participation of blockchain enthusiasts. That's why Orchid's partnership with leading blockchain infrastructure innovator [Bloq](https://www.bloq.com/) is a crucial step in adding even more incentives to join our network, helping users earn revenue from the exchange of private bandwidth.

In addition to serving as a bandwidth provider on the platform, Bloq is building an interface that will help token holders stake tokens and contribute to the bandwidth marketplace. With this interface users will be able to delegate their stake of Orchid's digital currency (OXT) to bandwidth providers, earning OXT without requiring any hardware to run an Orchid node. While this staking interface will be released later this year, users who are interested in delegating their stake to bandwidth providers can [sign up for the waitlist starting today](https://www.bloq.com/orchid/).

Orchid CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse (Seven) said: "Bloq is a leader in the blockchain space and is a key partner in helping grow the Orchid network. Incentivization is the missing piece in peer-to-peer privacy, and making it easy for people to earn tokens by delegating their stake to bandwidth providers will do exactly that. Bloq is a key partner in our goal of creating a community that makes the Internet a more free and private place."

Matthew Roszak, Chairman and Co-Founder of Bloq said: "Privacy and blockchain have emerged as the two most important topics in technology over the past decade. Orchid is rooted deeply in both of these conversations. We're proud to play a role in building this interface and in the network that will deliver on the promise of combining quality-of-service and enhanced privacy in the VPN space."
