Orchid is now faster and easier to use than ever, thanks to two important improvements our team has recently rolled out. These upgrades to the Orchid server and client have increased VPN speeds across the platform. People using Orchid can now expect pages to load even faster and connection speeds to improve noticeably.

To achieve these performance improvements on the server side, the team made targeted modifications to the SCTP layer of the WebRTC stack, which have improved the congestion control algorithms. On the client side, a modification was made to the maximum transmission unit (MTU), which regulates the size of a packet, to avoid SCTP fragmentation. Together, these two upgrades offer Orchid users an improved experience through faster connections on the Orchid protocol.

Orchid is a unique VPN app that lets people split their traffic into "hops" across multiple nodes, providers and protocols. Users can fund an Orchid account using its native digital currency, [OXT](/how-oxt-works-on-the-orchid-network/), and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis. People using the iOS and macOS apps can also purchase pre-filled accounts through [in-app purchases](/why-orchids-in-app-purchases-are-a-game-changer-for-dapp-usage/), with no need to obtain cryptocurrency or use a wallet. Orchid is completely ad-free and the app contains no tracking software.

Through innovations like [probabilistic nanopayments](/introducing-nanopayments/), the Orchid protocol is designed to ensure ample bandwidth supplies and fast connection speeds at all times. The recent upgrades are expected to further enhance connection speeds for users, making it even easier to explore the Internet freely.
