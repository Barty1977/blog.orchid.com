At EthDenver this year, we are looking forward to continuing to spread Orchid’s mission of promoting an open and accessible Internet, where users can explore with confidence knowing that they have next-level privacy protection. We can’t wait to share our progress with you in Denver, and learn more about what others are building in the Web 3.0 ecosystem.

Our booth will be in the “Shill Zone” **Friday, February 14th through Sunday, the 16th.** The Orchid crypto-powered VPN is now live and available to [start using today at Orchid.com.](https://www.orchid.com/) At our ETHDenver booth, we’ll be handing out a limited number of Orchid free trials to help Bufficorns on a first-come basis join the privacy network and start browsing privately on the spot.

Throughout the weekend, there will be additional opportunities to meet Orchid and learn how the dapp uses Ethereum and decentralization to help people get better control over their digital privacy. Stop by the main stage to catch Orchid Co-Founder and CEO **[Dr. Steven Waterhouse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waterhousephd/)** speak about the runup and clash between surveillance and privacy technologies.

For hackers who want to learn more about the unique [probabilistic nanopayment system](https://blog.orchid.com/introducing-nanopayments/) that Orchid uses as a layer-2 scaling solution on top of Ethereum, our engineering team is offering a **workshop on Saturday at 11:30 am MT.** Orchid engineers Justin Sheek and Nathan Handler will showcase Orchid’s probabilistic nanopayment system, which allows users to pay on a per-packet basis, and demonstrate how to start using it in your dapp. 

We hope to see you at the event! If you haven’t applied yet, applications are open: visit [ETHDenver's website](https://www.ethdenver.com/) for more details.
