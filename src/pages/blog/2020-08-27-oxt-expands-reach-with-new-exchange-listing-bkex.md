OXT, the Orchid token, will be listed on [Bkex](https://www.bkex.com/), a digital currency exchange with a large Mandarin-speaking user base. Deposits are open, and trading begins August 28 at 18:30 (UTC+8). Bkex provides services to over 1.8 million users in 208 countries around the world.

"We're excited to have OXT listed on Bkex, which is one of the leading exchanges in the Chinese-speaking community," said Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO. "This listing can help spread the opportunity to explore the Internet in privacy to more people in more parts of the world."

New users can open an Orchid account by purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH on Bkex. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code will appear that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a simple, one-step setup.

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. People use OXT to fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis. Users of the iOS and MacOS apps can also purchase pre-filled accounts using [in-app purchases](/orchid-launches-in-apple-app-store/).

Lion Ji, CEO of Bkex, said, "Today's Internet users expect a safe, encrypted experience online, but for a variety of reasons, that is not the case. The creation of Orchid is making up for the deficiencies in the current online environment."
